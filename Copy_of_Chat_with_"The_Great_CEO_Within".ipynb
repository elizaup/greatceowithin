It involves analyzing the energy consumption patterns, identifying areas of energy waste or inefficiency, and providing recommendations for improvements to reduce energy consumption and costs. The audit typically includes a thorough examination of the building's insulation, HVAC systems, lighting, appliances, and overall energy management practices. The goal is to identify opportunities for energy savings and to develop a plan for implementing energy-efficient measures.\n",
